# Linear-Regression-EXAMPLE

Hey just a project so show how to do some linear regression and understand the concept coming from the very basic. 
Implementing the way of getting the minimum error with code and trial and error. Of course in the future there are functions that do it directly.
Getting the intuition and seeing step by step in Jupyter was the idea!

Feel free to comment.
